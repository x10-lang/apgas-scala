\section{Distributed \kmeans Clustering}
\label{sec:kmeans}

Problem definition. Why it's ``easy'' to distribute.

Contrast with actors: messaging and communication is implicit vs. explicit.

Shared memory is not idiomatic in Akka, whereas embraced in APGAS. Ex: updating
the central array. This means we end up with code that requires concurrency
control.

Here we just used \lstinline{synchronized}. If Java had a proper
implementation or arrays with atomic increments for floats (analogous to
\lstinline{AtomicIntegerArray}), we could also just use that.
