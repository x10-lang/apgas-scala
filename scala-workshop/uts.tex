Problem definition. Maybe show a partial tree.

Concurrent work-stealing.

Figure~\ref{fig:uts-state} shows the main state transitions.

Common implementation of WorkList. Show interface. Explain mutability and
ownership are for performance.

Akka: implementation using vanilla actors (no akka-fsm). Work is split up by
sending \lstinline{Work} messages to oneself. State transitions are implemented
using \lstinline{become}.

Termination is difficult.

UTS: three problems, three solutions.

UTS \apgas: concurrency control implemented as multiple paradigms (synchronized
data access, global invariants, active messages). Concurrency is more
fine-grained.
