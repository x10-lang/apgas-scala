\apgas (Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space) is a model for
concurrent and distributed programming, known primarily as the foundation of
the X10 programming language. In this paper, we present an implementation of
this model as an embedded domain-specific language for Scala. We illustrate
common usage patterns and contrast with alternative approaches available to
Scala programmers. In particular, using two distributed algorithms as examples, we
illustrate how \apgas-style programs compare to idiomatic Akka implementations.
We demonstrate the use of APGAS places and tasks, distributed termination, and distributed objects.
% and fault-tolerance.
