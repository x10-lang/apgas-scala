Asynchronous Partitioned Global Address Space (APGAS) is a model for concurrent
and distributed programming, known primarily as the foundation of the X10
programming language. In this paper, we present an implementation of the model
as an embedded domain-specific language for Scala. We illustrate common usage
patterns and contrast with alternative approaches available to Scala
programmers.
