\paragraph{UTS.} We measured the rate of traversal of our Akka and
\apgas implementations of UTS in millions of nodes per second (Mn/s), using
32-way parallelism on a 48 core machine. We measured three configurations: 1)
\apgas implementation on 32 processes, 2) Akka implementation on 1 process with
32 worker actors, 3) Akka implementation on 32 processes, each with 1 worker
actor.\footnote{As places in \apgas are currently only realized as separate
processes, configuration 3) is closer in terms of communication constraints.}
We used \lstinline{akka-remote} for 3), and the flexibility of the actor model
means that the distribution of workers per process is isolated to a single
invocation of \lstinline{.withDeploy}. The configurations achieved 269.4Mn/s,
286.8Mn/s, and 274.2Mn/s, respectively. This shows that the \apgas code comes
within 98\% and 93\% of the performance of the multi-process and single-process
Akka configurations, respectively.
