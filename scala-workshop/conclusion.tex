\section*{Conclusion}
% \label{sec:conclusion}
\apgas is a concurrent and distributed programming model where the structure of
computation and distribution is fully explicit. Our work brings this model to
Scala. We demonstrated the coding style through examples, showing that the
resulting programs, while following a different structure, are comparable in
complexity and performance to actor-based implementations.
