\section{Selected Implementation Details}
\label{sec:serialization}

\paragraph{Distribution and Failure Detection.}
Hazelcast.

\paragraph{Serialization.}
Use of type class, mostly to support primitive types and
\lstinline{java.io.Serializable} together. In principle, paves the way for
relying on pickling \cite{MillerETAL13InstantPicklesGeneratingObjectorientedPicklerCombinators} in future work.

\paragraph{Closures and capture.} Currently not checking. Ideal use case for spores \cite{MillerHallerOdersky14SporesTypebasedFoundationClosuresAgeConcurrency}.
