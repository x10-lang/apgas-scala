\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:perf}

We ran our Akka and \apgas implementations of \kmeans and UTS on a 48 core
machine, measuring the performance of configurations with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and
32 workers. For the \apgas programs, the number of workers corresponds to the
number of places. For the Akka programs, $n$ workers correspond to $n+1$
actors: for both benchmarks we used the idiom of a master actor supervising the
workers and detecting termination, as described in Sections~\ref{sec:kmeans}
and~\ref{sec:uts}.

We ran our Akka programs by allocating one process for each worker actor, and
using \lstinline{akka-remote} for communication. This configuration \TODO

All numbers were obtained by averaging the results of three runs.

% \paragraph{UTS.} We measured the rate of traversal of our Akka and
% \apgas implementations of UTS in millions of nodes per second (Mn/s), using
% 32-way parallelism on a 48 core machine. We measured three configurations: 1)
% \apgas implementation on 32 processes, 2) Akka implementation on 1 process with
% 32 worker actors, 3) Akka implementation on 32 processes, each with 1 worker
% actor.\footnote{As places in \apgas are currently only realized as separate
% processes, configuration 3) is closer in terms of communication constraints.}
% We used \lstinline{akka-remote} for 3), and the flexibility of the actor model
% means that the distribution of workers per process is isolated to a single
% invocation of \lstinline{.withDeploy}. The configurations achieved 269.4Mn/s,
% 286.8Mn/s, and 274.2Mn/s, respectively. This shows that the \apgas code comes
% within 98\% and 93\% of the performance of the multi-process and single-process
% Akka configurations, respectively.
