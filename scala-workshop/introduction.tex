\subsection{Contrasting APGAS, Futures, Actors}

Terminology: places, tasks.

Discuss future \{ \} vs async \{ \} (returning void means no value).

finish counts (including distributed tasks!) and has no real equivalent.

Actors: unified model for concurrency and distribution.

Handling failures: Try vs Exception vs. Messages

Async at: active messages: get executed "immediately", actor messages handled one-by-one.

UTS APGAS: concurrency control implemented as multiple paradigms (synchronized
data access, global invariants, active messages). Concurrency is more
fine-grained.


\subsection{Illustrative Example: UTS}

Problem definition.

Concurrent work-stealing.

Distributed?

Resilient?
