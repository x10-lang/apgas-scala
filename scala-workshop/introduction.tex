\subsection{Contrasting APGAS, Futures, Actors}

Terminology: places, tasks.

Discuss future vs.\ async (returning void means no value).

finish counts (including distributed tasks!) and has no real equivalent.

Actors: unified model for concurrency and distribution.

Handling failures: Try vs Exception vs. Messages

Async at: active messages: get executed "immediately", actor messages handled one-by-one.

UTS APGAS: concurrency control implemented as multiple paradigms (synchronized
data access, global invariants, active messages). Concurrency is more
fine-grained.

\begin{lstlisting}
for(p $\lA$ places) {
  asyncAt(p) {
    println("Hello from " $\PL$ here)
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Illustrative Example: UTS}

Problem definition.

Concurrent work-stealing.

Distributed?

Resilient?

In the following sections, we highlight some of the points above through two
benchmarks, \kmeans clustering and unbalanced tree search.
